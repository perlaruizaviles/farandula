## GDS Explanation
A Global Distribution System is a network operated by a company which main function consists in enabling automated transactions between travel service providers (mainly airlines, hotels and car rental companies) and travel agencies. 
It can link services, rates and bookings consolidating products and services across all three travel sectors: i.e., airline reservations, hotel reservations, car rentals.

Farandula uses and feeds from three of the main GDS in the world:

- Amadeus
- Travelport
- Sabre

Each GDS has its own implementation since requests and responses are built different.
